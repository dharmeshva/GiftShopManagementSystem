Create a specific class to handle database connections and activities in a safe and effective manner. This is known as the Database Connection Class.
Normalised Database (2NF): To guarantee the best possible data organisation and integrity, design and implement a normalised database schema (2nd Normal Form).
Desktop-based App: Create an application that runs on a desktop computer and offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy user interaction.
Property Usage: To encapsulate data and guarantee safe and restricted access, make heavy use of properties within the codebase.
Form Validation: To ensure data integrity and validate user inputs, implement strong form validation procedures.
Search Functionality: Give consumers the ability to quickly find presents or pertinent information inside the application by providing a search function.
Use the public, private, and protected access modifiers wisely to control class members' visibility and accessibility in a secure manner.
CRUD Operations: To make managing gift products and customer data easier, use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Login Authentication: To ensure safe access to the system, implement a login form that requires user ID and password authentication.
